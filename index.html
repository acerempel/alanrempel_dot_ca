      <h1>
        Hello!
      </h1>
      <p>I am Alan, greeting you by means of this hypertext which I typed with my own hand.
      <p>Although this website that I have made for myself is (intentionally) quite spare,
         I am also capable of creating more colourful and contentful websites.
         For example:
      <ul>
        <li>The website of Manitoba author <a href=https://joanneepp.com>Joanne Epp</a>.
        <li><a href=https://greiffenbergsonnets.ca><i>Catharina Regina von Greiffenberg: Sonnets and Songs</i></a> â€“ a blog where
            a trio of writers publish new translations of the little-known 17th-century German-speaking poet for whom the site is named.
        <li>My own blog, <a href=https://www.threedots.ca>Three Dots</a>.
      </ul>
      <p>The first two are custom <a href=https://wordpress.org>WordPress themes</a>; the third is made with <a href=https://statamic.com>Statamic</a>.
      <address>You can contact me by email at my first name dot my last name at gmail dot com.</address>
